# F1 Pole Predictor
F1 Pole Predictor allows users to predict the 10th pole position in Formula 1 races. Analyze race data, make accurate predictions, and compete for the most precise forecasts.

This is a hobby project of mine, and a lot of effort has been made to create a fun 'guessing' game to make F1 more intereseting. 
The app is getting fairly complex, so if anyone wants to improve the code, please feel free to help out.
