# F1 Pole Predictor

This page summarises the intended workflow to turn this idea into reality. 
In time this will be adjusted and explored in more detail.

## Planning and Design:

- [ ] Define user stories and requirements.
- [ ] Design wireframes and user interfaces for the app.
- [ ] Decide on the tech stack and frameworks to be used.

## Backend Development:

- [ ] Set up a backend server using a framework like Flask or Django (Python-based) or Express.js (Node.js-based).
- [ ] Implement user authentication and profile management.
- [ ] Integrate with an F1 API to fetch live race data.
- [ ] Create endpoints to handle user predictions, store them in a database, and calculate scores after the race.
- [ ] Implement logic for scoring predictions based on race results.

## Frontend Development:

- [ ] Develop user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (potentially using frameworks like React or Vue.js for more dynamic interfaces).
- [ ] Create pages for user authentication, profile management, race prediction, leaderboard, and dashboard.
- [ ] Ensure responsiveness and accessibility across different devices and screen sizes.

## Integration and Testing:

- [ ] Integrate the frontend with the backend APIs.
- [ ] Perform thorough testing to ensure the app functions as expected.
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) to gather feedback and make necessary improvements.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

- [ ] Deploy the app to a web server (e.g., using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean).
- [ ] Monitor the app's performance and security.
- [ ] Regularly update the app with new features and bug fixes based on user feedback.

## Optional Enhancements:

- [ ] Implement real-time updates for race progress during live events.
- [ ] Add social features such as sharing predictions or competing with friends.
- [ ] Enhance the dashboard with personalized insights and statistics.

## Tools and technologies
Now, let's explore some specific tools and technologies that can be used for each stage of development:

- Backend Frameworks: Flask, Django, Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- Frontend Frameworks: React, Vue.js, Angular
- API Integration: Use F1 data APIs (such as Ergast API) for fetching race data.
- Authentication: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for token-based authentication.
- Deployment: Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, Netlify
